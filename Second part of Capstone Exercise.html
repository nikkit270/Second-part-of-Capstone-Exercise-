<p>I believe I’ve learned many things while taking this course. The many things I have observed, through the course work, through other’s observations on our readings/work, and through Professor Graham’s leadership. I have learned about various code editors such as Github to edit coding for websites. After an extensive research online, I realized that without this course, I wouldn’t know major digital coding techniques that I have learned throughout the course. A couple of students showed me how to code (change background colours, change images/writing, change the header, etc.) and from the information I have taken from this exercise, has helped me realize the potential I have in understanding what is the best in a website regarding its content, information, research, aesthetic and development. I think I appreciated and enjoyed the content of Pickering’s website more than the look and aesthetic. This is why I attempted to change more of the webpage itself then the content because I felt it would be more appealing to its target audience. I can relate this back to the work we did in Week 2 of the course, ‘Finding Data’. We used DH Box to practice coding in HTML. This helped set me up to attempt to code the website, and alter it in ways I would change it for digital historians.</p>
